    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Agentic AI** refers to AI systems that act autonomously to achieve goals by perceiving their environment, making decisions, and executing actions. Unlike simple AI that responds passively, agentic AI can **plan, reason, and take sequential actions** to complete tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key characteristics of agentic AI:\n",
    "- **Autonomy:** Works independently to achieve goals.  \n",
    "- **Reactivity:** Perceives the environment and reacts to changes.  \n",
    "- **Proactiveness:** Plans future actions to achieve objectives.  \n",
    "- **Goal-Oriented:** Focused on achieving predefined or dynamically set goals.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Example:\n",
    "- A robot vacuum planning a cleaning path dynamically.  \n",
    "- AI financial assistant recommending and executing trades automatically.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "## Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "An agent is an AI entity that perceives its environment through sensors and acts through actuators. Agents can be:\n",
    "- **Simple reflex agents:** Take actions based on current inputs.  \n",
    "- **Model-based agents:** Maintain internal state to handle partially observable environments.  \n",
    "- **Goal-based agents:** Plan actions to achieve a specific goal.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Agency\n",
    "Agency is the **capacity of an AI system to act independently**, take initiatives, and make decisions that affect outcomes.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Tools\n",
    "Tools are **external functions or modules** that an agent can use to perform tasks (e.g., calculator, web search, translation).  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Reasoning\n",
    "Reasoning is the ability to **analyze information, plan steps, and draw conclusions** to achieve goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of reasoning:\n",
    "- **Deductive:** From general rules to specific conclusions.  \n",
    "- **Inductive:** From specific examples to general rules.  \n",
    "- **Abductive:** Inferring the best explanation for observed facts.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Simple AI Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "A **simple agent** is a program that can take an input and perform actions without complex reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example: Calculator Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "**Concept:**  \n",
    "- Takes a mathematical expression as input.  \n",
    "- Computes the result.  \n",
    "- Returns output.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Python Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Simple Calculator Agent\n",
    "def simple_calculator(expression):\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        return eval(expression)\n",
    "    except Exception as e:\n",
    "        return f\"Error: {e}\"\n",
    "\n",
    "result = simple_calculator(\"15*7 + 10\")\n",
    "print(\"Simple Agent Result:\", result)\n",
    "````\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Reasoning Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "A **reasoning agent** can plan multiple steps to achieve a goal, often using tools and external knowledge sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example Goal:\n",
    "\n",
    "* \"Calculate 15 * 7 and then add 10\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use calculator tool to compute `15*7`.\n",
    "2. Add `10` to the result.\n",
    "3. Return final answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Reasoning Agent with Tool\n",
    "class Tool:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, func):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "        self.func = func\n",
    "\n",
    "class ReasoningAgent:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "        self.tools = {}\n",
    "\n",
    "    def add_tool(self, tool):\n",
    "        self.tools[tool.name] = tool.func\n",
    "\n",
    "    def run(self, goal):\n",
    "        if \"calculate\" in goal.lower():\n",
    "            expression = \"15*7 + 10\"\n",
    "            return self.tools[\"Calculator\"](expression)\n",
    "        return \"Goal not recognized.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Define calculator tool\n",
    "calculator = Tool(\"Calculator\", lambda x: eval(x))\n",
    "\n",
    "# Initialize agent\n",
    "agent = ReasoningAgent(\"LocalReasoningAgent\")\n",
    "agent.add_tool(calculator)\n",
    "\n",
    "goal = \"Calculate 15 * 7 and then add 10\"\n",
    "response = agent.run(goal)\n",
    "print(\"Reasoning Agent Response:\", response)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "# Multimodal Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "A **multimodal agent** can handle **different types of input and output**, e.g., text, images, audio.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Input: Text query or image of a handwritten math problem.\n",
    "* Output: Text answer or solved equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python Concept Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example conceptual pseudo-code\n",
    "class MultimodalAgent:\n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "\n",
    "    def handle_input(self, input_data):\n",
    "        if isinstance(input_data, str):\n",
    "            return f\"Text processed: {input_data}\"\n",
    "        elif isinstance(input_data, bytes):\n",
    "            return \"Image/audio processed\"\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            return \"Unknown format\"\n",
    "\n",
    "agent = MultimodalAgent()\n",
    "print(agent.handle_input(\"Solve 15*7\"))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
