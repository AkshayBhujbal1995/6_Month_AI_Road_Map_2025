    "# MCP Client and Server with Claude — Full Theory & Practical Plan\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "###  What is MCP?\n",
    "MCP stands for **Model Context Protocol**.  \n",
    "It is a standardized communication protocol that allows AI models and external tools to interact smoothly and securely.  \n",
    "\n",
    "MCP makes it possible to build **Agentic AI systems**, where:\n",
    "- The **AI model** (e.g., Claude) focuses on **reasoning** and decision-making.\n",
    "- The **MCP server** exposes **tools** (functions, APIs, services).\n",
    "- The **MCP client** acts as a **bridge** between the AI and the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short:  \n",
    "> **Claude thinks → MCP Client listens → MCP Server executes → Claude answers.**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Why MCP?\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Traditional vs MCP\n",
    "In traditional AI apps:\n",
    "- LLMs only respond to text prompts.\n",
    "- No real-world action or integration.\n",
    "\n",
    "With MCP:\n",
    "- The AI can call real tools.\n",
    "- It can fetch live data, execute logic, access APIs, and more.\n",
    "- It becomes a **true agent**, not just a chatbot.\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Benefits of Using MCP\n",
    "- **Structured communication:** standardized tool calls.\n",
    "- **Modular system:** you can add/remove tools easily.\n",
    "- **Real-time execution:** server runs logic, Claude uses the results.\n",
    "- **Security:** clear separation between model and tool execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "###  MCP Server\n",
    "- The server is like a **toolbox**.\n",
    "- Each tool is a Python function exposed using MCP capabilities.\n",
    "- It waits for requests from the client.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example tools:\n",
    "- `calculator`\n",
    "- `get_weather`\n",
    "- `fetch_data_from_api`\n",
    "- `translate_text`\n",
    "\n",
    "###  MCP Client\n",
    "- The client is the **bridge** between Claude and the server.\n",
    "- It knows what tools are available (capability discovery).\n",
    "- When Claude wants something, the client calls the server tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Claude (The Agent)\n",
    "- Claude receives user input.\n",
    "- It decides if a tool is needed.\n",
    "- It instructs the MCP client to call a specific tool.\n",
    "- It uses the result to craft a smart final answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "##  MCP Communication Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Step-by-Step Flow\n",
    "1. 🧠 User sends a prompt to Claude.  \n",
    "2. 🤖 Claude decides: “I need to use a tool for this.”  \n",
    "3. 🧭 Claude sends a request to the MCP client.  \n",
    "4. 🧰 MCP Client calls the right tool on the MCP server.  \n",
    "5. 🛠️ MCP Server runs the function and returns structured data.  \n",
    "6. 📩 MCP Client sends this data back to Claude.  \n",
    "7. 🧠 Claude uses the tool’s result and gives the **final answer**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
