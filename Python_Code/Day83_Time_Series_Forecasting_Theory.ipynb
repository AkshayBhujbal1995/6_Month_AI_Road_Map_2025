    "**Time Series — Theory Notes**\n",
    "\n",
    "# What is a Time Series?\n",
    "\n",
    "- A time series is a sequence of data points recorded at successive intervals of time.\n",
    "- **Examples**: daily stock prices, monthly rainfall, hourly temperature, yearly GDP.\n",
    "- The key difference from other data: **order matters** (yesterday influences today).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Components of a Time Series\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Trend** → Long-term upward or downward movement (e.g., rising housing prices).\n",
    "- **Seasonality** → Regular repeating pattern over fixed periods (e.g., ice cream sales higher in summer).\n",
    "- **Cyclic patterns** → Fluctuations without fixed periods, often related to business/economic cycles.\n",
    "- **Noise (Residual)** → Random variation that cannot be explained.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Stationarity\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **stationary time series** has constant mean, variance, and autocovariance over time.\n",
    "- Why important? Many models (ARIMA, SARIMAX) assume stationarity.\n",
    "- Non-stationary → Apply transformations (log, differencing) to stabilize.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Autocorrelation\n",
    "\n",
    "- Measures how observations relate to their past values.\n",
    "- **ACF (Autocorrelation Function)** → correlation of a series with its past lags.\n",
    "- **PACF (Partial Autocorrelation Function)** → correlation of a series with past lags after removing effects of shorter lags.\n",
    "- Helps in deciding AR (autoregressive) and MA (moving average) terms in ARIMA.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Decomposition\n",
    "\n",
    "Breaking a series into:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Trend\n",
    "2. Seasonality\n",
    "3. Residuals\n",
    "\n",
    "Two methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Classical decomposition** (simple, additive/multiplicative).\n",
    "- **STL (Seasonal-Trend decomposition using Loess)** (robust and modern).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Forecasting Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "## Naive Forecast\n",
    "\n",
    "- Assumes tomorrow’s value = today’s value.\n",
    "- Simple baseline to compare with advanced models.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Moving Average\n",
    "\n",
    "- Forecast = average of recent values (smooths short-term fluctuations).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exponential Smoothing\n",
    "\n",
    "- Weights recent observations more heavily.\n",
    "- Holt-Winters method handles trend + seasonality.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# ARIMA Models\n",
    "\n",
    "- **ARIMA(p,d,q)**\n",
    "    - **p** = autoregressive part (dependence on past values).\n",
    "    - **d** = differencing (to make data stationary).\n",
    "    - **q** = moving average part (dependence on past forecast errors).\n",
    "- **SARIMA/SARIMAX** adds seasonal components and exogenous variables (e.g., holidays, marketing campaigns).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Modern Approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Auto-ARIMA** → automatically selects the best p, d, q.\n",
    "- **Prophet (by Meta)** → easy-to-use, handles multiple seasonalities and trend shifts.\n",
    "- **Machine Learning (LSTM, GRU, Transformers)** → capture long-term dependencies in sequential data.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Model Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "- Metrics:\n",
    "    - **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)** → average absolute errors.\n",
    "    - **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)** → penalizes large errors.\n",
    "    - **MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)** → percentage-based error.\n",
    "- **Cross-validation for time series** → rolling window or expanding window approach (can’t shuffle like normal ML).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Practical Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "- Stock price prediction\n",
    "- Weather forecasting\n",
    "- Industrial demand forecasting\n",
    "- Sales & supply chain management\n",
    "- Autonomous driving (sensor data)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Key Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "- Always check for **stationarity** before applying models.\n",
    "- Start simple (Naive, Moving Average), then move to advanced (ARIMA, SARIMAX).\n",
    "- Use decomposition to understand patterns before forecasting.\n",
    "- Always validate using appropriate metrics and cross-validation.\n",
    "- Deep learning is powerful but needs large data and compute\n",
    "\n",
    "#  Summary & Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "- Time series analysis helps in **understanding patterns** and **predicting the future**.\n",
    "- Common models used:\n",
    "  - **Moving Average** → Simple smoothing method\n",
    "  - **Exponential Smoothing (Holt-Winters)** → Captures trend & seasonality\n",
    "  - **ARIMA** → Handles trend, autocorrelation, differencing\n",
    "  - **Prophet** → Flexible, easy to use, especially for business forecasting\n",
    "- Model performance can be compared using **MAE** and **RMSE**.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Next Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Try different hyperparameters for ARIMA `(p,d,q)`  \n",
    "- Explore SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) for strong seasonality  \n",
    "- Use real datasets (sales, weather, finance) instead of dummy data  \n",
    "- Experiment with Prophet for holiday effects and business applications  \n",
