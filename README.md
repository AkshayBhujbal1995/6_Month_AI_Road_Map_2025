## üó∫Ô∏è How This Journey Is Organized:

My learning materials are meticulously organized by day, following a consistent naming convention: `DayX_ConceptName`. If multiple concepts or chapters were covered on the same day, they are thoughtfully distinguished (e.g., `Day8_Concept1`, `Day8_Concept2`).

Here‚Äôs a snapshot of the repository's structure:

* **`0_Python_Everything_By_Day/`**:
    * Your daily dose of **theoretical insights** and conceptual clarity. This directory contains all the PDF notes and explanations that form the backbone of each day's learning.

* **Topic-Specific Code Folders**:
    * `1_Python_Basic/`
    * `2_Python_Libraries/`
    * `3_Control_Statements_And_Functions/`
    * `4_EDA_Exploratory_Data_Analyse/`
    * `5_Functions_As_Classes/`
    * `6_SQL/`
    * `7_Statistics/`
    * `8_Machine_Learning/`
    * `9_Artificial_Intelligence_(AI)/`
    * `All_Data_Sets/`
    * `Assignments/`
    * `Python_Code/`
    * `SQL_Code/`
    * **The Hub of Practicality**: These folders are where theory comes to life! Dive into **practical Python and SQL code** in Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb`), organized meticulously by day and specific topic.

* **`Projects/`**:
    * **The Heart of Applied Learning**: This is where all the accumulated knowledge culminates. Each subfolder here showcases **end-to-end solutions** to real-world problems, complete with both the Python code notebooks and their corresponding PDF explanations/documentation.
