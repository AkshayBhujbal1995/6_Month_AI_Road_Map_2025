# ðŸ“Œ AI, Generative AI, and Agentic AI â€“ Main & Subtopics

## 1. Artificial Intelligence (AI)
- **Definition:** Machines performing tasks that usually require human intelligence.
- **Types of AI:**
  - Narrow AI (Specific task-focused)
  - General AI (Human-level capability)
  - Superintelligent AI (Beyond human intelligence)
- **Core Areas:**
  - Machine Learning
    - Supervised Learning (Regression, Classification)
    - Unsupervised Learning (Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction)
    - Reinforcement Learning (Policy-based, Value-based)
  - Deep Learning
    - Neural Networks (Perceptron, MLP)
    - CNNs
    - RNNs (LSTM, GRU)
    - Transformers (Attention, BERT, GPT)
  - Natural Language Processing (NLP)
    - Tokenization
    - Stopword Removal
    - Stemming & Lemmatization
    - POS Tagging
    - Named Entity Recognition (NER)
    - Sentiment Analysis

## 2. Generative AI (Gen AI)
- **Definition:** AI that can create new content from learned patterns.
- **Key Concepts:**
  - Large Language Models (LLMs)
  - Transformer architecture
  - Prompt engineering
- **Common Applications:**
  - Text generation (ChatGPT)
  - Image generation (DALLÂ·E, Midjourney)
  - Music generation (AIVA)
  - Code generation (GitHub Copilot)
- **Examples:**
  - Writing an article
  - Creating realistic images from text prompts
  - Generating software code

## 3. Agentic AI
- **Definition:** AI systems that can autonomously plan, decide, and take actions to achieve goals.
- **Key Components:**
  - Reasoning
  - Memory
  - Tool usage (APIs, external integrations)
  - Planning & execution
- **Frameworks:**
  - LangChain
  - Auto-GPT
  - BabyAGI
- **Examples:**
  - AI travel planner (books tickets, hotels, adjusts plans)
  - AI research assistant (gathers info, writes reports, sends emails)
