## 📌 Project Overview  
This project focuses on building a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify fruits as **fresh or rotten**.  
The model is trained on a dataset of apple and orange images, and predicts whether a fruit is fresh or spoiled.  

Such a system can be useful in the **food industry**, supermarkets, and automated fruit-sorting machines to maintain quality standards and reduce food wastage.

## 🚀 Project Pipeline  

1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing**  
   - Collected fruit images (Fresh 🍏 / Rotten 🍎 / Fresh 🍊 / Rotten 🍊).  
   - Applied resizing, normalization, and augmentation techniques.  

2. **Model Building**  
   - Built a **CNN model** using TensorFlow/Keras.  
   - Used **Convolution + MaxPooling layers** for feature extraction.  
   - Dense layers for classification (Softmax output).  

3. **Training & Evaluation**  
   - Trained on labeled dataset.  
   - Evaluated using accuracy, loss, and confusion matrix.  

4. **Testing**  
   - Tested with unseen fruit images.

## 💡 Business Problem Solved  
- Automates **fruit quality checking**.  
- Reduces **manual inspection errors**.  
- Helps supermarkets, vendors, and food industries **reduce food waste**.  
- Improves **customer satisfaction** with fresh produce.  

---

## ⚡ Technologies Used  
- **Python** 🐍  
- **TensorFlow / Keras**  
- **OpenCV** (Image preprocessing)  
- **NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib**  

---

## 🔎 Limitations  
- Dataset limited to **apples and oranges only**.  
- Model accuracy can reduce with **poor lighting** or **damaged fruits**.  
- Needs larger and more diverse dataset for production-level deployment.  

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements  
- Extend to multiple fruit categories (bananas, mangoes, grapes).  
- Deploy as a **web/mobile application** for real-time usage.  
- Improve accuracy with **Transfer Learning (ResNet, VGG, MobileNet)**.
